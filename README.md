# 📊 Data Analysis App

Welcome to my **Streamlit Data Analysis App**—a project designed to showcase practical data science skills and interactive data exploration.

This application enables users to upload CSV files, filter and summarize datasets, and visualize data through a variety of interactive plots—all within a user-friendly web interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Upload and preview CSV datasets
- Generate summary statistics and data previews
- Filter data by column and value
- Visualize data with Line, Bar, Histogram, and Scatter plots
- Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## 🎬 Demo
