# 📊 Data Analysis App

Welcome to my **first ever Streamlit project**!  
I built this out of boredom and to make a change of taste during my MERN backend journey.  
This app lets you upload CSV files, filter data, and visualize it with interactive plots—all in your browser.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload your own CSV data
- Preview and summarize your dataset
- Filter data by any column and value
- Visualize data with Line, Bar, Histogram, and Scatter plots
- Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## 🎬 See It in Action!

Curious how the app works?  
Check out this quick demo video to watch data being uploaded, filtered, and visualized in real time:
